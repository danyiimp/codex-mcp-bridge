## Check which copy you are in

The same tree is often reachable at more than one path. A project on a drive
shared between a dual-boot Windows install and macOS appears under its drive
letter on one side and under a mount point on the other, and **macOS mounts
NTFS read-only**: writes fail there, so edits are lost and that checkout
silently drifts behind `origin`.

Confirm before editing:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
test -w . && echo "writable" || echo "READ-ONLY - you are in the wrong copy"
```

Work in a checkout on a writable local disk and let the other machine pull.

`resolveWorkspacePath()` in `src/platform.mjs` exists for the same reason: a
brief written on one machine quotes whichever path that machine uses, and the
other machine cannot always use it.

## Before pushing

```bash
npm test          # the whole suite: no Codex install, no login, no quota
npm run check     # boots the bridge against a real app-server and lists threads
```

`npm test` is the gate, and CI runs the same command on Node 22 and 24 across
Linux, macOS and Windows. It works against a fake app-server and a throwaway `HOME`, so
it is the one to run on every commit.

`npm run smoke` sends real turns to Codex and spends quota — run it when the
change touches turn handling, not on every commit.

## Adding a tool

Every tool declares `annotations` with all four hints (`readOnlyHint`,
`destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`), a description, and a
description on every parameter. `test/tool-contract.test.mjs` enforces it and
also pins which tools are read-only and which are destructive, so a tool that
changes character has to say so in the test too.

Be literal about `readOnlyHint`: `read_claude_inbox` drains the inbox as it
reads, and `claude_bridge_status` registers the peer endpoint on its first
call. Neither is read-only, whatever its name suggests.

## Undocumented protocols

Two things this project talks to have no published schema: the Claude Code peer
protocol in `src/peer-protocol.mjs`, and the Codex Desktop native tools pipe in
`src/native-relay.mjs`. Both are measured, not documented, and both can change
without notice.

Anything resting on one of them must be optional, feature-detected, and safe
when it is absent - never the default path, and never a hard dependency of a
tool that would otherwise work. Keep the unverifiable shape in one named
function with one test pinning it, so a protocol change is a small edit in a
place someone can find rather than a hunt through a request body.

## Nothing here may depend on one person's setup

Nothing tracked here may name a real home directory, volume or checkout. Use
placeholders (`/Users/<user>`, `/Volumes/<label>`, `~/code/<project>`) so the
repository reads the same for everyone who clones it.

Nor may it carry instructions from somewhere the reader cannot open — a private
repository, or a personal rule, memory or skills file kept outside this
project. Whatever a contributor has to obey belongs in this repo, in English.

`test/repo-hygiene.test.mjs` enforces both, alongside the English-only rule.

## Releasing

Fork releases use a version tag matching `package.json`, such as
`v1.18.0-csb.1`. Run `npm test` and `npm pack` before tagging, then publish a
GitHub release with the resulting tarball. The
`.github/workflows/github-packages.yml` workflow publishes the tagged version
to GitHub Packages after its own test run. This fork has no npmjs.com publish
workflow.

`npm version` runs `scripts/sync-version.mjs`, which rewrites the `VERSION`
constants in the entrypoints to match and stages them. `test/repo-hygiene.test.mjs`
fails the build if they disagree.

## Protocol questions

Do not guess method names or payload shapes. The app-server ships its own
schema:

```bash
codex app-server generate-json-schema --out /tmp/codex-schema
```

`ServerRequest.json` lists every request the server sends to a client; each one
needs a reply, and an unanswered method stalls the turn instead of raising an
error.
## GitHub Packages mirror

The github-packages.yml workflow validates an existing version tag, runs npm ci
and npm test, checks the version and changelog, then publishes under the GitHub
owner scope @danyiimp using GITHUB_TOKEN with packages:write. The original
project's package on npmjs.com stays unchanged.
The repository URL associates the GitHub package with this repository.

Push a version tag for future publications, or manually dispatch this workflow
from main with an existing release tag. Published versions are not overwritten.
The workflow verifies registry metadata and downloads the published package.
After first publication, verify package visibility and repository association in
GitHub settings; new packages default to private.
