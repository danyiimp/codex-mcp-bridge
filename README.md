Send prompts and replies between **Claude and Codex**, keeping each conversation in its own app. Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux; native Desktop integration supports Windows and macOS.

Adds persistent session creation in both directions, project/model/effort and permission controls, and recovery tools for uncertain requests. A combined MCP server registers directly with Codex and Claude Code.

**Install from GitHub (no CCS or package-registry login required):**

```bash
npm install -g github:danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge#v1.18.0-csb.1
```

The combined server is registered with `cross-session-bridge-install` as described in [Standalone Cross Session Bridge](#standalone-cross-session-bridge). The original bridge entrypoints are still available.

## Installation

### GitHub Packages

The repository-linked copy is [@danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge](https://github.com/danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge/packages)
on npm.pkg.github.com. The npmjs.com package `@minhspark/codex-mcp-bridge` belongs to the original project; install this package from GitHub using the command above when registry authentication is unavailable.
GitHub's npm registry requires authentication with a classic token with read:packages,
even for public packages. Authenticate locally and never commit a token:

```bash
npm login --scope=@danyiimp --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --auth-type=legacy
npm install -g @danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then follow the platform registration and verification instructions below.

[Windows](#windows-powershell) · [macOS](#macos-terminal) · [Linux / WSL](#linux--wsl-bash) · [Claude Code registration](#register-claude-code) · [Verify](#verify-the-installation) · [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

Choose the mode for the conversations you want to connect:

| Platform | Mode | Required clients |
|---|---|---|
| Windows / macOS | Native Desktop tasks | Signed-in Codex Desktop and a Claude **Code** session in Claude Desktop |
| Linux / WSL | CLI / app-server | Signed-in Codex CLI and a running Claude Code CLI session |

The bridge requires **Node.js 22+**; Node 24 LTS is a suitable starting point. If Node is already managed by a version manager, use that installation. Install the bridge under the same OS user as the clients. A global npm install does not require cloning this repository.

For Desktop mode, install [Codex Desktop](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app) and [Claude Desktop](https://claude.com/download), sign in, and save the intended local project in Codex Desktop. Open that same directory in Claude Desktop's Code tab. A normal Claude chat is not a Code session.

### Windows (PowerShell)

Install Node and a native Codex executable with WinGet:

```powershell
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS --exact
winget install --id OpenAI.Codex --exact
```

Open a **new PowerShell window** so it receives the updated PATH, then run:

```powershell
node --version
npm.cmd --version
codex.exe --version
codex.exe login
npm.cmd install -g github:danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge#v1.18.0-csb.1
$env:CODEX_EXE = (Get-Command codex.exe).Source
codex-native-relay-install.cmd --desktop-tasks
codex-mcp-bridge-install.cmd --desktop-tasks
$env:CODEX_BRIDGE_DESKTOP_TASKS = "1"
claude-mcp-bridge-install.cmd
```

The `.cmd` suffix selects npm's Windows launchers without changing PowerShell's execution policy. `CODEX_EXE` must point to the real `codex.exe`, not an npm `.ps1` shim. If WinGet is unavailable, install [App Installer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) or use the vendors' installers.

Continue with [Claude Code registration](#register-claude-code), then [verification](#verify-the-installation).

### macOS (Terminal)

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed:

```bash
brew install node@24
export PATH="$(brew --prefix node@24)/bin:$PATH"
node --version
npm --version
npm install -g @openai/codex@latest github:danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge#v1.18.0-csb.1
codex --version
codex login
codex-native-relay-install --desktop-tasks
codex-mcp-bridge-install --desktop-tasks
CODEX_BRIDGE_DESKTOP_TASKS=1 claude-mcp-bridge-install
```

Add the same Node PATH line to `~/.zshrc` if this is your Node installation; use `~/.bashrc` for Bash. If Homebrew is not installed, the [Node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is another option; skip the two Homebrew lines after installing it.

Keep the bootstrap enabled on a first relay install: it creates the executor required by native delivery. `--no-bootstrap` is for an already configured executor. On macOS, the relay installer selects the runtime bundled with Codex Desktop for native app authentication.

Continue with [Claude Code registration](#register-claude-code), then [verification](#verify-the-installation).

### Linux / WSL (Bash)

Use a Linux terminal with `curl`, `unzip`, and Bash available. This example uses [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#installation) to install Node without system-wide npm permissions:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
```

Open a new Bash terminal so fnm's shell setup loads, then run:

```bash
eval "$(fnm env --use-on-cd --shell bash)"
fnm install 24
fnm default 24
fnm use 24
node --version
npm --version
npm install -g @openai/codex@latest github:danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge#v1.18.0-csb.1
codex login
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
claude --version
CODEX_BRIDGE_DESKTOP_TASKS=0 claude-mcp-bridge-install
```

Start `claude` once and complete sign-in, then exit back to the shell. Register the forward bridge below, then reopen Claude or reconnect its MCP server:

```bash
bridge_root="$(npm root -g)/@danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge"
claude mcp add --scope user codex-bridge \
  -e CODEX_BIN="$(command -v codex)" \
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_DESKTOP_TASKS=0 \
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_AUTOSTART=1 \
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_THREAD_POLICY=roots \
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_ROOTS="$HOME" \
  -- "$(command -v node)" "$bridge_root/src/mcp-supervisor.mjs" index.mjs
```

Use an existing writable project under your home directory, or replace `$HOME` in the allowed roots with the intended project directories. Keep both CLI clients running under the same Linux user. The bridge starts its local app-server on demand; no native relay installer is needed. This mode does not provide native Desktop project assignment. WSL and Windows have separate paths and client registrations; use the Windows instructions to connect Windows Desktop tasks.

### Register Claude Code

**Claude Desktop configuration and Claude Code's MCP registry are separate.** If the sending Code session does not have `codex-bridge`, register it below. These are first-registration commands; if `claude mcp get codex-bridge` already returns an entry, preserve its custom environment and access settings when updating it.

Install the Claude Code CLI if `claude --version` is unavailable. The [official setup guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) provides these native installers:

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Open a new terminal after installation. Linux users who completed the preceding section are already registered. For **Windows Desktop mode**:

```powershell
$bridgeRoot = Join-Path ((npm.cmd root -g).Trim()) '@danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge'
$nodeBin = (Get-Command node.exe).Source
$codexBin = (Get-Command codex.exe).Source
claude mcp add --scope user codex-bridge `
  -e "CODEX_BIN=$codexBin" `
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_DESKTOP_TASKS=1 `
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_AUTOSTART=0 `
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_THREAD_POLICY=roots `
  -e "CODEX_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_ROOTS=$env:USERPROFILE" `
  -- $nodeBin (Join-Path $bridgeRoot 'src/mcp-supervisor.mjs') index.mjs
```

For **macOS Desktop mode**:

```bash
bridge_root="$(npm root -g)/@danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge"
claude mcp add --scope user codex-bridge \
  -e CODEX_BIN="$(command -v codex)" \
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_DESKTOP_TASKS=1 \
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_AUTOSTART=0 \
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_THREAD_POLICY=roots \
  -e CODEX_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_ROOTS="$HOME" \
  -- "$(command -v node)" "$bridge_root/src/mcp-supervisor.mjs" index.mjs
```

These examples allow projects under the current user's home. For projects elsewhere, supply their actual absolute directories, separated by `;` on Windows or `:` on macOS/Linux. `--scope user` makes the registration available across projects; it does not override the allowed roots.

### Verify the installation

Check registration from a terminal; on Windows use `codex.exe` if `codex` resolves to a blocked PowerShell shim:

```bash
node --version
codex --version
claude --version
claude mcp get codex-bridge
codex mcp get claude-bridge
```

For Windows/macOS Desktop mode, also run `codex mcp get codex-native-relay`. Reconnect the affected MCP servers in the **existing** client tasks; Claude Code exposes them through `/mcp`. If a client has no reconnect control, restart that client after its active work finishes.

Ask the active tasks to run these **MCP tools**, not shell commands:

| Where | Tool | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `codex_bridge_status` | Current runtime; native relay and saved projects available in Desktop mode, or a working app-server in CLI mode |
| Codex | `claude_bridge_status` | Current runtime and the intended Claude session policy |
| Codex Desktop only | `native_relay_status` | Account relay listening and native tools available |

The registered supervisor should report auto-reload enabled. Next, list the intended destination with `list_codex_threads` or `list_claude_sessions`, then send a short message and verify its reply. A package version or a running process alone does not establish successful delivery.

## Standalone Cross Session Bridge

The combined server is a separate MCP entrypoint in this package. A regular Claude Code installation with its default `~/.claude` configuration is enough; CCS is not required. If CCS is installed, the bridge discovers its profiles and lets you select one explicitly. The upstream entrypoints and the platform setup above remain available. On macOS and Windows, install the native relay using the platform instructions, ensure the `claude` CLI is installed and signed in, then register the combined server for both clients:

```bash
cross-session-bridge-install --both
```

In PowerShell use `cross-session-bridge-install.cmd --both`. `--codex` or `--claude` registers just one side; add `--remove` to undo that registration. The installer discovers the real Codex and Claude executables and records their absolute paths, so a restricted MCP `PATH` does not change which clients run. You can set `CODEX_EXE` and `CLAUDE_BIN` to explicit executable paths before installation. Reconnect the `cross-session-bridge` MCP server in existing Codex and Claude Code tasks, then call `bridge_status` to check `apiVersion`, capabilities and `autoReload`.

From a Codex Desktop task, call `create_claude_session` with an absolute project `cwd`, a `message`, and a stable `request_id`. It starts a persistent native Claude Code background session and returns its `sessionId`. Choose `model` (`fable`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`), `effort` (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`), and `permission_mode` (`manual`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`) when needed. The default permission mode is `manual`; explicit `bypassPermissions` requires a verified full-access Codex caller. Claude must already trust the project. Use `profile: "default"` for a normal installation, `"CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR"` when that environment variable selects another Claude configuration, or `"CCS:<profile-name>"` for a discovered CCS profile. `mcp_mode: "none"` skips the new session's external MCP servers.

Read a new session with `read_claude_session(target=sessionId, cwd=..., profile=...)`; continue its live conversation with `send_to_claude_session` using the exact ID. `get_claude_request(cwd=..., request_id=...)` recovers an uncertain creation without starting another session. The request ID is scoped to the calling Codex task and canonical project directory. Reading returns bounded text and native status separately; acceptance is not task completion. Attach interactively with the returned command if the session needs a user decision.

From Claude Code, `create_oai_session` creates a persistent Codex Desktop task; `read_oai_session` and `get_oai_request` recover its result, and `send_to_oai_session` continues it. The bridge starts these tasks with full access (`approval_policy: never`, `danger-full-access` sandbox, network enabled), so give them work you intend to run with those permissions. Pin `model` and `effort` on creation or follow-up when appropriate. Claude's own sessions keep the permission mode selected at creation.

This combined entrypoint has been verified on macOS with Claude Code's native `--background` support. The original upstream CLI/app-server mode remains documented for Linux/WSL; the combined Desktop task path needs the native Desktop relay.

## Use

| Direction | Tools |
|---|---|
| Claude → Codex | `list_codex_threads`, then `send_to_codex_thread` |
| Codex → Claude | `list_claude_sessions`, then `send_to_claude_session` |
| Create a Codex task | `delegate_to_codex` with `cwd` and `prompt` |

Example requests:

- **In Claude:** “Send this review request to my existing Codex task in this project and wait for its reply.”
- **In Codex:** “Send this result to my Claude Desktop Code session in this project and confirm its reply.”

Use the exact project directory and destination task. If several Claude sessions match, specify the task ID. A `reply_received` receipt confirms a reply; a timeout does not mean the task stopped, so inspect it before retrying.

The sending tools ask agents to write each prompt in English with these sections, dropping any that do not apply: `Goal`, `Context`, `Task`, `Scope`, `Constraints`, `Done when`, `Reply format`. The first line names the sender, the project and the purpose. Text the user supplied is sent unchanged.

```text
[From Claude Code · my-app · edit coordination]

## Goal
Avoid conflicting edits while Claude Code patches `src/export.ps1`.

## Task
1. Do not modify `src/export.ps1` or `README.txt` until told otherwise.
2. Write any unsaved edits to those files to disk now.

## Reply format
Exactly one line: `DONE — changed: <files>` or `DONE — no changes`.
```

## Important behavior

- Desktop mode uses the native relay and the apps' permissions; it does not fall back to an external app-server.
- Account switches are checked before delivery. Missing identity or incompatible permissions block sending.
- Access settings are preserved on reinstall. Review allowed workspaces before enabling the bridge.
- CLI/app-server setup, all tools, and advanced settings are in the [reference](https://github.com/danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge/blob/main/REFERENCE.md).

## Update

```bash
npm install -g github:danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge#v1.18.0-csb.1
```

Supervisor-based installs reload compatible updates when idle. Older installs or changed MCP settings need a one-time reconnect; see [upgrade instructions](https://github.com/danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge/blob/main/REFERENCE.md#upgrading-an-install-you-already-have).

On Windows, use `npm.cmd` if PowerShell blocks `npm.ps1`. Upgrade the Codex CLI with the same manager used to install it: `winget upgrade --id OpenAI.Codex --exact` for the Windows path above, or `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest` for the macOS/Linux path. Updating the bridge does not update the clients.

If Node moved or a registration still points at an old installation, rerun the corresponding platform registration steps and reconnect its MCP server. Preserve existing access settings. Use `--no-bootstrap` only when refreshing a relay that already has an executor.

## Troubleshooting

### Download or installation failed

| Error / symptom | What to check and how to fix it |
|---|---|
| `node`, `npm`, or a bridge command is not found | Open a new terminal. Check `node --version` and `npm --version`. On Windows run `Get-Command node.exe` and `npm.cmd prefix -g`; the global prefix must be on PATH. On macOS/Linux run `command -v node` and `npm prefix -g`; its `bin` directory must be on PATH. Reload your Node version manager's shell setup if used. |
| `EBADENGINE`, missing `WebSocket`, or Node older than 22 | Switch to Node 24 with the installer/version manager above, reinstall the bridge under that Node, then refresh MCP registrations that reference an old executable. |
| PowerShell says `npm.ps1` or an installer script cannot be loaded | Use `npm.cmd` and the bridge installer's `.cmd` command shown above. For Codex use `codex.exe`; keep machine execution policies unchanged. |
| `EACCES` on macOS/Linux | Use a user-owned Node version manager, then reinstall globally under that Node. See npm's [permission error guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally/). |
| `EPERM`, `EBUSY`, or a file is in use on Windows | Let active work finish, close the process named in the error if it owns the package files, and retry the same npm command. Check the reported path's permissions or security-software event if it persists. |
| `E404` for the bridge | Check the exact package name `@danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge`. Run the registry checks below; a private mirror may not contain the package. |
| `ETIMEDOUT`, `ECONNRESET`, DNS, proxy, or certificate errors | Run the registry checks below. Correct the configured proxy or use the CA certificate supplied by the network administrator. Keep TLS verification enabled. |
| Claude installer returns HTML, `403`, or a curl error | Use the alternatives and error-specific fixes in [Claude Code installation troubleshooting](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting). |

Run these registry and cache diagnostics; in PowerShell replace `npm` with `npm.cmd`:

```bash
npm config get registry
npm ping
npm view @danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge version --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
npm cache verify
```

If the public registry works but a configured mirror does not, update the mirror configuration or, where permitted, install once from the public registry:

```bash
npm install -g github:danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge#v1.18.0-csb.1
```

### Installed, but the bridge does not connect

Start with `codex doctor` for Codex installation problems and `claude doctor` for Claude Code. Then inspect the MCP registrations and the status tools in [verification](#verify-the-installation).

| Error / symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `codex binary not found`, `ENOENT`, or Windows `EINVAL` during registration | Locate the actual executable. Set `CODEX_EXE` before rerunning the installer: PowerShell `$env:CODEX_EXE = (Get-Command codex.exe).Source`; macOS/Linux `export CODEX_EXE="$(command -v codex)"`. On Windows, do not point it at `codex.ps1` or `codex.cmd`. |
| Tools appear in Claude Desktop but not in its Code task | Complete the separate [Claude Code registration](#register-claude-code), then reconnect `/mcp` in that Code session. |
| Installer refuses an entry with custom access/timeout settings | Keep those settings. Update only the existing entry's `command` and `args` to the values printed by the installer, then reconnect. |
| Desktop task still reports `app-server` | Rerun `codex-mcp-bridge-install --desktop-tasks`; set `CODEX_BRIDGE_DESKTOP_TASKS=1` in the separate Claude Code registration too. Refresh the reverse registration with the same setting and reconnect the actual sending task. |
| Relay is installed but unavailable | Open Codex Desktop and reconnect `codex-native-relay`. Check `codex mcp get codex-native-relay` and the in-task `native_relay_status`; a registered entry alone is insufficient. |
| `RELAY_THREAD_UNCONFIGURED` | Rerun `codex-native-relay-install --desktop-tasks` without `--no-bootstrap` to create the missing executor. |
| macOS `untrusted-code-signing-identity` or `NATIVE_DELIVERY_UNCONFIRMED` | Inspect the client logs and the installer's `relay runtime:` line. Rerun the relay installer with Codex Desktop installed; if runtime detection fails, set `CODEX_NATIVE_RELAY_NODE` to the actual app-bundled runtime. Relaunch the companion after active work finishes. Inspect any original delivery before retrying. |
| Linux says native relay unavailable | Use the Linux CLI setup with `CODEX_BRIDGE_DESKTOP_TASKS=0` on both registrations. Native Desktop relay support is Windows/macOS only. |
| No Claude sessions or no matching saved project | Keep the intended Code session open under the same OS user. In Desktop mode, use a Claude Desktop Code session and an existing saved Codex project with the exact local path. Check both clients are signed in. |
| `NOT AUTHORIZED` / workspace refused | Inspect `CODEX_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_ROOTS` and `CODEX_BRIDGE_THREAD_POLICY`. Add the intended writable project path to the relevant registration and reconnect; retain unrelated restrictions. |
| Account identity unavailable / changed | Complete sign-in in the intended clients and recheck their status. Desktop routing requires supported local account identity; API-key or unsupported credential storage is not a substitute. See [account requirements](https://github.com/danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge/blob/main/REFERENCE.md#switching-desktop-accounts). |
| Runtime is stale or update pending | Check the configured installation path and `autoReload` status. Active calls and unresolved deliveries defer a reload. Let them finish; reconnect once for legacy registrations or changed environment variables. |
| Task is “open in another application” | For Desktop tasks, use the native mode above. For CLI/app-server tasks, let the owning turn finish and release its subscription before opening elsewhere. |
| CLI mode cannot connect after reboot | Check `codex_bridge_status`, the configured endpoint, and whether autostart is enabled. The CLI setup uses `ws://127.0.0.1:8791`. If manually starting `codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:8791`, first confirm no server already owns that endpoint. |
| CLI server says the model needs a newer Codex | Update Codex, then restart the specific old app-server after its active work finishes. Updating files does not replace an already running process. |
| Send timed out / reply unconfirmed | Read the original task or delivery receipt before retrying. A timeout does not cancel the task, and retrying can send it twice. |

For unresolved failures, [open an issue](https://github.com/danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge/issues) with the OS, Node/bridge/client versions, the failing command, and the relevant redacted status/error. Leave out tokens, credentials, and private conversations. More detail is in the [technical reference](https://github.com/danyiimp/codex-mcp-bridge/blob/main/REFERENCE.md#troubleshooting).

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm test
```

On Windows, use `node --test --test-concurrency=2` (also avoids npm versions that reject forwarded flags). CI tests Node 22 and 24 on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Tests use isolated fixtures and do not spend model quota. Upstream telemetry reporting is disabled.
